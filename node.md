# Node.js Installation & Uses

Node.js ***v14.19.1*** is used to develop this WP Theme with Theme Redone. This combination of Node and Theme Redone helps you easily build the block theme through some magical automation. But, unless you know Node.js already, it can prove tricky to setup and use on your computer.

To make it easier, be sure to use the Node Version Manager package, so you can maintain multiple versions of Node.js on your local computer. This capability it central to the process because you need to use Node.js ***v14.19.1***.

## Installation
